# yBank App

> yBank - Vue(Nuxt) SSR Frontend for Test Assignment

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install / npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev / npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build / npm run build
$ yarn start / npm run start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate / npm run generate
```

## Remarks
The frontend works, I did my best with the knowledge I have to fix the most common edge cases (refactor, SoC, etc..), I'm aware of more UX issues and possible improvments, but we can put 'em in the backlog. I know there's more work that can be done to make this even better as the app grows (scales) and I'm open to learning and doing so much more to the best of my abilities.
