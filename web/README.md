# yBank

> yBank - Vue(Nuxt) SSR Frontend for Test Assignment

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install / npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev / npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build / npm run build
$ yarn start / npm run start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate / npm run generate
```

## Remarks
The frontend works, I did my best to fix the most common edge cases, I'm aware of more UX issues but lets put 'em in the backlog for now, lets shipâ€”i know there's more work to make this great.

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
