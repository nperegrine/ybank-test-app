> Laravel and Vue(Nuxt) Test Assignment 

## Key Considerations
The following key considerations where taken into account when working on this Test Assignment:

* **Security** - Prevent hacking
* **Best Practices** - Write code that is clean and easy to maintain
* **Documentation** - Provide information on how to setup the project
* **Tests** -  Tested the parts that I felt where most important
* **Logic** - yBank should not allow overspending of account balance

## Remarks
I have tried to do my best within the context of the Test Assignment. I'm aware they may be more issues that could be improved but lets put 'em in the backlog for now, lets shipâ€”i know there's more work to be done to make this great. Thank you so much!
