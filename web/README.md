# yBank App

> yBank - Vue(Nuxt) SSR Frontend for Test Assignment

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install / npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev / npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build / npm run build
$ yarn start / npm run start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate / npm run generate
```

## Remarks
I did my best within the given period of time and within the context of the test assignment to fix and finish the most common edge cases. I know there's more work than can be done to make this even better and I'm open to learning and doing more.
